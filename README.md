## Introduction
Modbus485 Sniffer is a diagnostic tool designed for listening and interacting with RS485 lines using the 
Modbus protocol. It enables users to manually send raw requests and monitor responses in a user-friendly 
GUI environment. This tool is ideal for debugging and developing systems using RS485 serial communication.

It has been tested only under linux but should work also under other Unix OS or Windows.
